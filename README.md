This Excel-based project analyzes real-time Blinkit data through complete data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation. Using formulas, pivot tables, and slicers, the data is converted into clear insights on orders, revenue, categories, and delivery performance, helping stakeholders identify trends and make better decisions.

Key Features

• Complete end-to-end Excel project • Data cleaning and formatting for analysis • Use of formulas, pivot tables, and slicers • KPI tracking for orders, revenue, and delivery performance • Interactive Excel dashboard with user-friendly visuals • Clear representation of trends and category performance

Problem Statement

Blinkit deals with high volumes of daily order and delivery data. The main challenge is turning raw, unorganized data into actionable insights. Without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to identify customer demand patterns, operational bottlenecks, and business performance trends.

Solution

Using Excel, I structured and cleaned the dataset, applied essential functions, and built pivot tables to extract insights. An interactive dashboard was then designed to track key metrics such as order volume, top categories, revenue trends, and delivery efficiency. This solution transforms raw data into easy-to-understand insights that help stakeholders make informed business decisions.
